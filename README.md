# Capstone-1-The-Fridge
Springboard capstone 1 project

This project is my first capstone project and is still a work in progress as there is many more features that I would love to add in the future. 

The overall flow of the project is users will log in and see an empty 'fridge'.

Within this frige the user can add ingredients by simply typing in what the want into the searchbar. The app will call to the ingredient api where the user can add those items to the fridge and they will see said ingredients when they return to the home page.

Once the user has a few ingredients in their fridge they can add them to the 'pot' along with the type of recipe they want to search for e.g pasta or rice.

The second recipe api will be called and return a list of recipes that contain the selected ingredients as well as recipes within the type specified. The user can save any recipes they want from this page as well as click more info on any recipe to see a detailed list of ingredients and instructions.

The user is also able to revisit any recipes that they have saved.

Some of the future goals I would like to see in this project is a lot more information about both ingredients as well as recipes. This will include both nutrition information as well as a similar recipe function so the users can more easily flow from one recipe to the next. I would like to add the ability to create your own recipe books and create lists of ingredients so it is easier for the user to take the app from the home to the store.
